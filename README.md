# Frontiers Pinball: Custom Settings Mod

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/97zyya3.jpeg)

A simple Sonic Frontiers mod for the PC version that I made to learn DLL mods in this game (and sigscan I guess.)

The mod allows you to change the settings of the pinball subgame on the Island 3. You can change the number of balls and the score requirement.
Default settings of the mod gives a much lower score requirement (100k instead of 500) and give you 6 balls instead of 3.
Of course, you can edit those to make this more challenging or even easier, that is up to you.
